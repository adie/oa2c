# Oa2c - OAuth2 Container

Rails OAuth2 provider engine to support embedded iframe applications from different sites. Just like games on Facebook.

Heavily depends on [rack-oauth2](https://github.com/nov/rack-oauth2) gem.

It's mostly extract from [rack-oauth2-sample](https://github.com/nov/rack-oauth2-sample).

Right now it supports only Mongoid 3 as ORM.
